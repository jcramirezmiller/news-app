## Week 02 Project


  

### Description - Objetives

  

Look for a new news in English, but we must pay attention to the HTML content and also to the style. The problem this week is to create a new HTML document that includes the CSS style to make the page look identical to the original newspaper when viewing. This should be done for both the new news and the one we created in week 1.  It will also be necessary to add a link at the beginning or at the end of each news item to navigate within the newspaper that we are creating. That is, from the news of week 1 to the news of week 2 and vice versa.

  

The new HTML link must be uploaded in response to the weekly goal before the end of the week.
