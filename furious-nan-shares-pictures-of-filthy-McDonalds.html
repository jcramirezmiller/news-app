                                A gran was left gobsmacked when she sent McDonald's "horrendous" photos of their
                                "filthy" restaurant, only for staff to take it as a compliment.

                                Ceri Pepper, 61, said she was "grossed out" by the mess she found at Crossways
                                Parc branch in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/caerphilly">Caerphilly</a>
                                while she was there to treat her family.

                                Photos show staff standing in spillages and dirt, while the kitchen is littered
                                with nuggets, chips and lettuce across the floor and serving area. Many of the
                                surfaces and units were encrusted with sauces and one staff member struggled to
                                hold a bottle of toffee sauce as it was coated in sticky liquid, Ceri said.

                                "It was gross. They'd kicked all the food underneath the units too," Ceri, from
                                Caerphilly, said. "It was horrible. It wasn't just one or two bits on the floor
                                that could be picked up - it was horrendous. The floor was dirty. It's not just
                                walked in food - it's walked in dirt.

                                "A member of staff was holding up the toffee sauce bottle with two fingers
                                for my McFlurry because the bottle was encrusted in sauce and she couldn't hold
                                it properly because it was so sticky."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I looked at the rest of the area and thought 'oh my goodness'. The general
                                eating area was like that too. All the orders were piled up. They weren't cleaning
                                anything. It was just piling up and piling up. I should have just said can I have
                                a refund but I just went outside and put all the food in the bin."

                                I went to Cardiff's lowest-rated restaurant and this is what it was like

                                After quizzing staff about the state of the restaurant, Ceri claims she was told
                                they were simply "too busy" to clean. A McDonald's spokesman has since said it was
                                an "exceptionally busy time" and "extra cleaning" took place as soon as they were
                                made aware of the issue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite spending £14 on three triple cheeseburgers, two fries and two McFlurrys,
                                the horrified gran says she left the restaurant and binned the food as
                                she 'didn't want to take the risk.
                            </p>

                                To make matters worse, when Ceri complained to McDonald's on social media and
                                showed them the shocking images, the chain replied saying: "Thanks for letting us
                                know, we love to hear when our restaurants impress with their cleanliness.
                                I'll pass your compliments onto the restaurant and staff members."

                                Ceri said: "When I saw their response on social media, I was gobsmacked.
                                I thought 'are they having a joke? Are they taking this seriously at all?'
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I phoned Environmental Health and sent them the photos. The lady I
                                spoke to said it wasn't acceptable and they needed to be going in. She said even
                                if they were busy it wasn't acceptable."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In response to the bizarre reply from McDonald's, social media users urged their
                                team to 'go to Specsavers'.

                                After Ceri called environmental health, a council spokesman confirmed that they
                                have "requested remedial actions to be undertaken by the restaurant" and will
                                be performing a follow-up visit.

                                Ceri, who later took her family to another McDonald's, claims she hasn't returned
                                to the Crossways branch since because she didn't want to "take the risk".

                                "The staff were oblivious to it," Ceri said. "I was watching them. I even stood
                                there in front of them and they were even oblivious to me being there. As I came
                                out I said to a young girl 'isn't anyone cleaning today' and she
